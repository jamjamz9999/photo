    content: `Golden hour is a favorite among portrait photographers for its soft, flattering light. In this guide, you’ll learn how to position your subject, use reflectors, and adjust your camera settings to make the most of this magical time.\n\n## Why Golden Hour Works\n\nThe low angle of the sun creates long shadows and a warm glow. This light wraps gently around your subject, reducing harsh shadows and making skin tones look beautiful.\n\n## Tips for Shooting\n\n- Arrive early to scout your location.\n- Use a wide aperture (f/1.8–f/2.8) for dreamy backgrounds.\n- Try backlighting for a halo effect.\n- Use a reflector to fill in shadows.\n\n## Camera Settings\n\nSet your white balance to "Cloudy" for extra warmth. Keep ISO low for clean images.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nPractice at different times during golden hour to see how the light changes.`,
